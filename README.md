# Mutual Axioms

Welcome to **Mutual Axioms** — a lifelong, curated collection of our most meaningful quotes. This is a private dialogue made public. It reflects how we think, how we've changed, and how we want to live. Each quote is a compass point.

## 🎯 Purpose

To distill clarity. To remember what matters. To track the ideas and values that withstand the test of time.

We keep it:
- **Concise** — Every quote here earned its place.
- **Evolving** — Quotes may be removed, replaced, refuted, or retired.
- **Personal** — Some include notes, others just resonate.
- **Precise** — Sources are cited, debated ones are labeled.

## 📂 Structure

- `adrian_quotes.md`: Adrian's current 10 quotes (max).
- `ernesto_quotes.md`: Ernesto's current 10 quotes (max).
- `shared_favorites.md`: Legendary status. Shared quotes we both revere. Max 5 entries.
- `retired_quotes.md`: Quotes we once loved but now outgrew or refuted.
- `README.md`: You're here.

## ✨ Rules

- **Each person keeps exactly 10 quotes.** Want to add one? Remove one.
- **Shared Favorites are sacred.** Max 5. Changes require both of us.
- **Retired quotes** live in `retired_quotes.md` for reference and respect.
- **Notes are optional**, but welcome.
- **Quote format**:

```
